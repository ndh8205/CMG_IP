## Intro

Trajectory tracking allows the system to follow a preset path over time. Using this method, the results of movement can be predicted through simulation without physical experimentation.
Trajectory tracking involves path planning and orbit generation. Path planning is about finding the optimal path to reach a goal from an initial state, given information about the robot and its surroundings. Trajectory generation specifically defines position, velocity, and acceleration functions over time to follow the planned path after path planning is complete.
There are several ways to track trajectories, but for this page we will use PID and FLC.
